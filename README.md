# Portfolio

This is my portfolio website built with NextJS. It's nothing fancy, but I like the fact that I was able to get SSR up and running 
so easily with Next.JS. The only issue I had was with FOUC due to the use of Google Fonts. I did not find a perfect solution for 
this in the end. I ended up just hiding the FOUC with an opacity animation, which I think covers it fairly well.
